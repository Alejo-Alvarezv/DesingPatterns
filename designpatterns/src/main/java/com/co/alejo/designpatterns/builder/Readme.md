# Builder

Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.

Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesn’t require products to have a common interface. That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.

In this example, the Builder pattern allows step by step construction of different car models.

The example also shows how Builder produces products of different kinds (car manual) using the same building steps.

The Director controls the order of the construction. It knows which building steps to call to produce this or that car model. It works with builders only via their common interface. This allows passing different types of builders to the director.

The end result is retrieved from the builder object because the director can’t know the type of resulting product. Only the Builder object knows what does it build exactly.

Output:
```
Car built:
SPORTS_CAR

Car manual built:
Type of car: SPORTS_CAR
Count of seats: 2
Engine: volume - 3.0; mileage - 0.0
Transmission: SEMI_AUTOMATIC
Trip Computer: Functional
